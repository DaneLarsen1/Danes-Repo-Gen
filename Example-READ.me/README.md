# Dane's READ.me Gen
  
  ## Description
  This project is a Node.js command-line application designed to dynamically generate a professional README.md file from user input. Utilizing the Inquirer package, it prompts users with a series of questions about their project, such as the title, description, installation instructions, usage, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and licensing. Upon answering these questions, the application uses the input to create a well-structured and formatted README file. This includes sections like a table of contents, installation steps, usage information, contribution guidelines, test procedures, and license details. The tool is particularly useful for developers looking to streamline the creation of README files for their GitHub repositories, ensuring they are comprehensive, professional, and consistent in style. This automation not only saves time but also helps in maintaining a standard quality for open-source project documentation.
